# Chapter 2: Programming Basics

In this chapter, you will be introduced to the most basic concepts of programming; variables, data structures, and control statements.

Programming is little more than reading data and piecing together statements that take action on that data. This is typically done by making a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree). In programming, these decision trees are constructed using [control-structures](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Control_structures) which tend to flow based upon the current value of memory addresses. These memory addresses are more commonly known as variables.  

In this chapter, you will learn about:
* variables
* data types
* control structures

The goal of this section is to provide an overview of basic programming concepts.
