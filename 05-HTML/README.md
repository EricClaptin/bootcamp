# Chapter 5: HTML

In this chapter, we will focus on the fundamentals of HTML and building a personal website aimed at personal branding. The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (MDN) is a great resource for development. Many of the lessons and pre-reading assignments will refer to MDN. 

In this chapter, you will learn:
* How to build a basic web page with HTML.
* How to publish a website on GitHub.
* How to build a web form.
* How to use third-party form processing.
* The basics of MetaData.

The goal of this chapter is to gain a basic understanding of HTML concepts, produce working web pages and publish a live website.
