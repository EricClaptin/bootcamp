# MicroTrain's Dev Bootcamp - key projects

## Dev Machine

Introduces the student to Ubuntu Linux and has the student build the development environment they will be using for the remainder of the class.

Key Concepts: Linux, Apt, CLI (the *nix command line), Apache
Output: A laptop running a Linux development environment.

Why: Understanding how your tools work is key to any craft. I'm assuming your already familiar with either Windows or Mac. Linux is popular among many dev shops. Learning Linux will increase your marketability. This is the same distro you'll use when building your webserver on AWS, learning it now will only make that task easier. 

## re.sh

Introduces the student to Programming basics, CLI, Bash Shell, and git

Key Concepts: Programming basics, CLI, Bash Shell, VCS and git
Output: A functional CLI application written in Bash
Reinforces: Apache

Why: Bash is a powerful, Turing complete language that can be used to build anything. I feel it's sweet spot is as a utility language; it's something I often use to script out repeatable processes such as the exact steps that have to be taken to modify an Apache configuration. It's great a item for your toolbox but a primary language.

## example.github.io

Introduces the student to HTML and CSS, the building blocks of modern development.

Key Concepts: HTML, CSS, VCS, git, and Github
Reinforces: git, Github
Output: A static website running on github.io

Why: GitHub is the defacto standard when it comes to providing access to OpenSource code. GitHub provides features beyond VCS such as hosting static sites. In addition to allowing the student to launch a production website this will provide the student some experience in using a git based workflow to push a website into production.

## draw

Introduces JavaScript and frontend coding concepts by applying them to a complex, interactive application.

Key Concepts: JavaScript, Canvas, Events
Reinforces: HTML, CSS, Programming Basics
Output: A drawing program

Why: Building this type of application allows the student to apply and connect major aspcets of JavaScript programming in a fun, easy to follow manner. 

## game

Reinforces JavaScript and frontend coding concepts by applying them to a simple game.

Key Concepts: Collision Detection, JavaScript, Canvas, Events
Reinforces: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Canvas, Events
Output: A simple game

Why: Lets be honest, gaming is what drew most of us here. While the larger field of game development is out of scope for this class applying what we have learned to building a simple game is a fun and effective way to reinforce common JavaScript and general coding concepts.

## nasa-apod

Introduces the students to APIs, jQuery, and AJAX.

Key Concepts: APIs, jQuery, and AJAX
Reinforces: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Output: A JavaScript application

Why: While the original goal of jQuery has been met by browser standards jQuery still has an overwhelming foot print on the web. API driven AJAX applications have moved from "wow that's cool" to the norm. This project will introduce the student to jQuery in the context of an API driven AJAX application using a popular NASA API.

## example.com

Introduces the student to PHP and MySQL by building a dynamic website.

Key Concepts: LAMP Stack, PHP, MySQL, CRUD, data processing, sessions, templates, programming basics
Reinforces: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Apache

Output: A fully functional content management system.

Why: The LAMP stack has been around for decades and is not going any where, any time soon. This particular application is built in what I often refer to as the "classic web" style in which the client and server have a tight coupling. Understanding a classic web application lays the foundation for everything we will learn later in the course. This serves as an introduction to PHP you can combine this with concepts learned later in the course to develop modern application using the LAMP stack and vice versa.

## cake.example.com

Introduces the student to PHP ecosystems, MVC concepts and frameworks using the CakePHP framework. 

Key Concepts: CakePHP, MVC, Composer
Reinforces: HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, CRUD, data processing, sessions, templates

Output: A functional implementation of a CakePHP project

Why: Ecosystems and frameworks are a big part of modern development. While the bulk of this course will focuses on NPM (JavaScript's defacto ecosystem) the eco-system/package management philosophy has found it's way into classics languages and is built in to newer languages. Understanding these concepts is transferable across languages and eco-systems.

## mean.example.com

Introduces the student to REST API development, JavaScript application development, and ExpressJS; a JavaScript framework for processing HTTP requests (aka back-end web framework)

Key Concepts: FullStack JavaScript, ES6, JavaScript, REST API, HTTP verbs, reverse proxies, process management
Reinforces: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EcoSystems, data processing, sessions, templates, Apache

Why: The separation of classic web stacks into Data APIs and front end applications are the cornerstone of modern application development. This project teaches the student how to build a REST API and connect to it using a front-end/client application. We end this lesson by setting a revesre proxy and process management and allowing the student an opportunity to launch into production.

### js-cms

A subset of *mean.example.com*, this project walks the student through the development of a JavaScript application for interacting with a JavaScript API.
Reinforces: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Gulp

### PM2 and Reverse Proxies in Apache

A subset of *mean.example.com*, this project walks the student through launching a production instance of an ExpressJS project.

## ng-apod

Introduces the student to Angular and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) by porting an existing application to a different platform.

Key Concepts: Angular, TypeScript, ReactiveProgramming, PWA, application porting
Reinforces: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and AJAX

Why: Angular is complex platform. By introducing you to the core Angular concepts using a simple program you are already familiar with you can focus more of you attention to the specifics of Angular rather than wondering how the program should work.

## Angular CMS

Using Angular we will build a front-end web application to replace the js-cms application from the earlier lesson.

### ng-auth

Reinforces: Angular, TypeScript, ReactiveProgramming, PWA, application porting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and AJAX

### ng-users

Reinforces: Angular, TypeScript, ReactiveProgramming, PWA, application porting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and AJAX

### ng-cms

Reinforces: Angular, TypeScript, ReactiveProgramming, PWA, application porting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and AJAX

## ionic-apod

Introduces the student to Ionic by building a familiar application.
Key Concepts: Ionic, Hybrid mobile
Reinforces: Angular, TypeScript, ReactiveProgramming, PWA, application porting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and AJAX

Why: Ionic is complex platform. By introducing you to the core Angular concepts using a simple program you are already familiar with you can focus more of you attention to the specifics of Ionic rather than wondering how the program should work.


## Ionic CMS

Using Ionic we will build standalone hybrid mobile ready PWAs for use on mobile platforms.

## ionic-auth

Reinforces: Ionic, Hybrid mobile, Angular, TypeScript, ReactiveProgramming, PWA, application porting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and AJAX

## ionic-users

Reinforces: Ionic, Hybrid mobile, Angular, TypeScript, ReactiveProgramming, PWA, application porting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and AJAX


## ionic-cms

Reinforces: Ionic, Hybrid mobile, Angular, TypeScript, ReactiveProgramming, PWA, application porting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and AJAX
