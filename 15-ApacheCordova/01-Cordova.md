# Apache Cordova
[Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) is a free and open source environment that allows us to use web technologies to target multiple platforms with a single code base. This is used primarily for mobile development. While we are able to write the code using web technologies, we still need access to that platforms build environment. Cordova provides a mechanism to compile technology into native application code but it still needs the native environment to build and test that package. If you want to compile your application into an iOS app you will still need access to a MAC running the latest version of xCode. Android on the other hand can build on Windows, MAC or Linux as a result we will focus our build on Android. For the most part, anything you build in Cordova for Android should run on iOS save for the occasional tweaks.

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) is the official IDE (Integrated Dev Environment) for building Andorid applicators, this provides everything you will need to build Android applications. There are however a few dependencies.

>> **Changes since last class**<br>
>> * Orcale's Java-JDK is no longer supported by Oracle<br>
>> * OpenJDk is now suported<br>
>> * Android Studio now ships with Gradle<br>
>> * The Linux download is now in the format of tar.gz instead of .zip<br>

In this lesson we will install
* Apache Cordova
* Java
* Gradle
* Android studio
* A few 32 bit binaries.

## Install Apache Cordova

Cordova is built on top of Node; we will use npm to do a global install.

```sh
sudo npm install -g cordova
```

## Install the Java SDK
Android runs on top of Java (and Java compatible APIs) we will need to install Java so we can compile our web based build into Java. We will use Oracle's JDK for this (there are rumors that Google will switch future build to Open-JDK).

Start by adding Oracle's PPA.

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
```

Update your list of apt repositories

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the JDK

```sh
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

Choose the desired installation
Run the command ```sudo update-alternatives --config java``` and chose from the resulting menu, which should be similar to the following. In this case, I selected option 0 _auto mode_

```
  Selection    Path                                     Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   1081      auto mode
* 1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode
```

You will need to set your JAVA_HOME Environment Variable (so that running programs can  find Java). To do this you will need to find your Java path; do this with the following command (the result of which will contain your Java path).

```sh
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

Now set the path using your favorite editor. In my case the path is at _/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java_ so I will add this line ```JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle"``` to the .bashrc file.

```sh
vim ~/.bashrc
```

Once you have added the that line, you will want to reload the file.

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

```sh
java -version
```

## Install Gradle

In short Gradle is a the build system used by Android. Stack Overflow has a [more detailed answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16754643/what-is-gradle-in-android-studio). You can install this using Apt, but the Ubuntu repos are a little behind on this one, so it's better to install it manually.

### Download and Unpack Gradle

```sh
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.2-bin.zip
sudo mkdir /opt/gradle
sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle gradle-5.2-bin.zip
```

### Add an Environmental Variable on Startup

Open the _environment_ file

```sh
vim ~/.bashrc
```

add the following lines, the first is for Gradle, the others you will need later so add them now.

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle-5.2/bin
export ANDROID_HOME=/home/$USER/Android/Sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

### Restart environment
```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install additional 32 bit libraries

```sh
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386
```

## Install the Android SDK

If you were to build an Android application from scratch, this is what you would use. Cordova needs access to the SDK for it's builds and we need access to the emulators. You will use Cordova to write the code, Cordova will use the Android SDK to build your applications and you will use Android Studio to build your emulators.

[Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

```sh
cd ~/Downloads
<strike>sudo unzip android-studio-ide-*-linux.zip -d /usr/local</strike>
cd /usr/local/android-studio/bin
./studio.sh
```

Follow the prompts and keep choosing next.

_
At some point you will be asked to create or import a new project. This is required but we will not use it. When prompted to do so, go ahead and create a project.
Create a new project called Hello World
* Choose create with no activity
_

You should now have a running instance of  Android Studio. Add a desktop entry _Tools > Create desktop entry..._ and lock Android Studio to your launcher.  

Now it's time to create an (AVD (Android Virtual Device))[https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html]

Tools > Android > AVD Manager
Click the _Create Virtual Device_ button
Choose Nexus 5x
Click on the _x86 images_ tab and choose _Nougat 25 x86_64_ (Download if required)
Choose the default options from the AVD screen and click _Finish_
From the _Your Virtual Devices_ dialog click the green arrow beside our new device.

Allow yourself permissions to the emulator
```sh
sudo chown $USER:$USER /dev/kvm 
```

## Hello World

Now let's get started with Cordova. We will start with the classic Hello World example. We will create our Hello World application is a package called hello. This will create a starter package with a few lines of source code to get your started.

```sh
cd ~
cordova create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld

cd hello
```

Check your list of platforms

```sh
cordova platform ls
```

Add the Android platform to your project.

```sh
cordova platform add android
```

Build and Android package from source code.

```sh
cordova build android
```

Start the emulator

```sh
cordova emulate android
```

Close the emulator.

## Debugging with Logcat.
[Logcat](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat.html) is the default android debugger, we can use this for tracking down issues in our web code. To do this we will want to add the [console plugin](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-console/) to our Cordova app.

```sh
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-console
```

Start your emulator and in another terminal start logcat
```sh
cordova emulate android

adb logcat
```

Everything that happens in the emulator is logged. Logcat ```adb``` is installed with android studio and lets us read the logs in real time. In a new console, run the logcat command.
```sh
adb logcat
```
You'll notice straight away that this is far too verbose to be useful, so your will want to run it with filters. We will use the regex filter to only return messages that have contain the string _INFO:CONSOLE_. This will limit Logcat's output primarily to ```console.log()``` calls. Making it far less verbose and allowing us focus on messages that matter.

```sh
adb logcat ActivityManager:I Cam:V -e INFO:CONSOLE*
```
