# MVC

MVC is a software design pattern that splits your application into three distinct layers; the data layer (Model), the logic layer (Controller), and the presentation layer (View).

### Model

A model can be anything that provides data such as a table in a database, a reference to an API, a spreadsheet, etc. For our use a model will reference a table in a database.

### View

Views are the presentation layer. Views will typically be HTML but can be anything a client can read such as .html, .json, .xml, .pdf or even a header that only a machine can access.

### Controller

Business and application logic.
