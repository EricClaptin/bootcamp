# PM2

## Introduction

PM2 is one of many process managers for NodeJS. We use it primarily to allow the server to auto-recover from errors and managing the number of processes running per machine.

If you have not done so already, force MongoDB to start up on boot.

```sh
sudo systemctl start mongod
sudo systemctl enable mongod
```

When the system boots up type the command ```mongo``` into a terminal window, if MongoDB starts up you ready for the next step. Exit out of Mongo and install PM2.

```sh
sudo npm -g install pm2
```

From the VSC explorer navigate to *mean.example.com* and add the file *process.yml* and add the following.
```yml
apps:
  - script: ./bin/www
    watch: true
    instances: 4
    exec_mode: cluster
    env:
      NODE_ENV: development
    env_production:
      NODE_ENV: production
```

Run the following to manually start PM2. PM2 will run until you kill the process manager or reboot the system.
```sh
cd ~/mean.example.com && pm2 start process.yml && cd ~
```

If you are in a production environment you will probably want you website to load on boot. You can do this by adding the previous command to your **.bashrc** file. 

>I would not recommend this for a dev environment. The crash helps you keep errors out of production.

*.bashrc* is a startup script that executes when a given user account is loaded.

```sh
cd ~
vim .bashrc
```

Add the following line.
```sh
cd ~/mean.example.com && pm2 start process.yml && cd ~
```

Then restart your bash script.
```sh
. .bashrc
```

Then restart apache2 server to point to the mean.example.com folder. Run the following commands.
```sh
sudo a2ensite mean.example.com
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Navigate to *loc.mean.example.com*
