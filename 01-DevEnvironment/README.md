# Chapter 1: Dev Environment

A development (dev) environment is just as it sounds. It is any system or configuration of systems in which a product is developed. This may be anything from a single laptop that runs code in a browser to a cluster of machines that perfectly emulates a production environment. Our environment will consist of a single laptop running full LAMP and MEAN stacks. Since the bulk of the course involves web development we can run most code in browser. Additional code will run in a terminal window, mobile device emmulator or on your own mobile device.

In this chapter,  you will learn:
* How to a dev environment from scratch.
* Basic Linux Commands.
* How to install Linux software.
* How to install the LAMP stack.
* The basics of NodeJS and NPM.
* The basics of Git and GitHub.
* How to use and SSH key for authentication.

The goal of this section is to gain an understanding of the dev environment and gain some comfort on a Linux command line.
