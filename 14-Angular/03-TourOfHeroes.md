## Tour of Heroes

Now that we have dipped our toes in Angular we will take a deeper look by walking through Angular's [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) tutorial. This will give us more insight into the inner-workings of Angular. Then we will create three separate apps (ng-auth, ng-users, ng-cms) which will serve as drop-in replacements for the single-page applications (SPAs) we wrote in vanilla JavaScript.
 
Open a browser and navigate to [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) and follow the instructor on a guided tour of heroes.

[Next: ng-auth](03-NgAuth.md)
