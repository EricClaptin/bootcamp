## Full Stack

A reference to both the front and back end of a web site, this generally inclusive the presentation, data and logic layers. Some "stacks" such as LAMP include OS and server software while others such as MEAN focuses on higher level tech. 

The MEAN stack is also said to be Full stack JavaScript in that all critical layers of the tech are written in JavaScript.   

A full stack developer is generally someone who is well versed in the presentation, data and logic layers.

My definition of a full stack developer is someone with end-to-end awareness. Someone who is capable of designing and building a complete solution. This person will likely have varying levels of mastery across the stack. At a senior level I would expect this person to have mastery of one or two areas, a solid foundation in most others, and perhaps a lower functional understanding of no one or two other areas. The key to long-term success is in knowing when to hand something of to a specialist and when to bring other devs into the fold.

This may or may include an access mechanism. https://www.microtrain.net and www.microtain.net are both examples of URIs. The former is also an example of a URL while the later is not. All URLs are URIs but not all URLs are URIs.

## URL

Uniform Resource Locator a type of URI to which an access mechanism has been prepended. https://www.microtrain.net is a URL while www.microtrain.net is not a URL. The later would be of the broader URI class. All URLs are URIs but not all URLs are URIs.
